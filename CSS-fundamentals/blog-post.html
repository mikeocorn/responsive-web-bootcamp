            <p>Wow, I can't believe it's happening! I feel like a 15 year old at <a href="">her quinceanera</a>, excited to enter the real world and show it what I'm made of!</p>
            <p>It's been a wild ride to get where I am today, but it is like the late Ernest Hemingway once wrote,<em>"Don't take life too seriously or you'll never make it out alive of life."</em> Anyways, I'm just glad you came to <a href="">read about me</a> and what I'm up to. Enjoy it!</p>
